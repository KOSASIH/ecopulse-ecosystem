EcoPulse Ecosystem Architecture
=============================

The EcoPulse Ecosystem is a decentralized, AI-driven, and sustainable economic framework that consists of several components. This guide provides an overview of the ecosystem's architecture and its various components.

### Components

* **SDK**: The software development kit (SDK) provides a set of tools and libraries for building applications and integrations on top of the EcoPulse Ecosystem.
* **AI Engine**: The AI engine is a decentralized AI platform that provides machine learning and predictive analytics capabilities to the ecosystem.
* **Blockchain**: The blockchain component provides a decentralized and secure ledger for storing and managing data and transactions within the ecosystem.
* **Data Hub**: The data hub is a centralized repository for storing and managing data from various sources within the ecosystem.
